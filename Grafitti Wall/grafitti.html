  <h1> Plan </h1>
   <br>
    <h3> Choose Your Wall</h3>
      <p>There are three walls for you to choose from. They are different in size and shape. Use the descriptions below to determine which wall will best fit your goal and if you are ambitious, you could do all three!</p>
        <dt>Wall 1: 30'3" x 9'6"</dt>
          <dd>This wall is very long and has a buildup of paint that you must work around.</dd>
        <dt>Wall 2: 22'3" x 9'11"</dt>
          <dd>This wall has a great surface to work on and will only require a stool.</dd>
        <dt>Wall 3: 24' x 12'3"</dt> 
          <dd>This wall is very large and will require a ladder to reach the top.</dd>
  <br>
   <h3> Sketch Your Design</h3>
      <p>Creating a design before you show up to paint is key to having a good experience. This will allow you to buy the proper amount of materials and make the excecution seamless.</p>

<!-- Prepare Section -->

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid  text-black" style="background-color:#2eda63; padding:50px 50px;">
  <h1>Prepare</h1>
  <br>
  <h3> Background</h3>
    <p>Before you paint your design, you will want to give the wall a coat of paint as your background color. This gives you a fresh canvas to work on. Pro tip: make sure to paint the beveled edge on the wall, as this makes your design look professional. </p>
    <p>Expect to use 1 gallon of paint per wall. </p>
    <p>Use roller heads for rough surfaces and it helps to have a roller extender on hand for those hard to reach spots!</p>
<br>
 <h3> Design Medium</h3>
    <p>To paint your design, you can spray paint, brush paint, or do a combination of both.</p>
    <p>If you choose to use spray paint, avoid generic brands and use high-end spray paint like Montana Gold WITH interchangeable caps.</p>
    <p>If you choose to brush paint, make sure your paint is acrylic based as it is one of the most durable and weather resistant</p>
  <br>
    <h3> What to Wear</h3>
    <p>Even the most professional grafitti artists can end up with drops of paint on their clothes. It is recommended that you wear old clothing and shoes in case of accidents or drips!</p>
    <p>Spray paint contains harsh chemicals so you will want to wear a paint respirator to protect you and your lungs.</p>
    <p>The weather must always be a part of your grafitti wall plan. If it is hot and sunny, make sure you wear a hat and sunscreen. If it is cold, it is recommended that you wear gloves to keep your fingers warm. Pro-tip: bring a small space heater to keep your paint warm. Finally, if it is raining...go home, painting in the rain is impossible.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Things to Bring</h3>
    <p>Items that are extremely helpful on painting day but are often overlooked include paper towels, water/snack, and a speaker for music.</p>
    <p>Bringing these additional items will make your experience enjoyable and you can dance while you paint!</p>

  <br>
    <h3> Preparing Your Design</h3>
      <p>Depending on the mural, you can trace your design on your “fresh canvas”. This ensures that your proportions will be correct and for beginners, it makes the painting process quicker.</p>
      <dt>Projecting </dt>
        <dd>There are outlets close to the wall where you can hook up a projector. This method requires you to have painting on your background color, allowing it time to dry, and then projecting/tracing a night the day before.</dd>
      <dt>Grid</dt>
        <dd>You can purchase chalk line and create a grid on the wall to guide your design. This method can be done during the day but requires a bit of math.</dd>
      <dt>Free Hand</dt> 
        <dd>You most certianly can freehand your design but for most people, they have never worked on a canvas this large so getting the proportions correct can be difficult. However, its paint! Any mess-ups can be covered so free-handing is a great way to organically learn.</dd>
